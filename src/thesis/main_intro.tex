\subsection{Thesis Contributions}
The main contributions of this thesis are two parts. This thesis's first contribution is that it proposes a system which collects, parses and stores data about research papers from computer science ArXiv. The system stores the parsed content structure, the tables of a research paper, the citations to and from a paper and uses this data to run various interfaces such as a search interface or a browser extension.  The thesis's second contribution is that it proposes various machine learning models which help classify tables describing comparisons using the data collected by the system. The disseration analyzes various Machine Learning models for the classification task and shows how the use of large amounts of data with self-supervised pretraining helps get a better performance for the task of table of comparison classification.

\section{Sci-Genie: Technical Debts and Shortcomings}
Although Sci-Genie provides a more context rich access to research, the components that help enrich context during search and parsing/indexing can be further improved. This section details the limitations of some components. Based on some of these limitations, future works is described in Section \ref{conclusion:future-scope}

\subsection{Heuristic Parsing}

\end{figure}
\refstepcounter{figurecounter}
As Sci-Genie uses a heuristic parser for parsing research documents. The heuristic parser correlates the Fragment object to the appropriate keys in the \nameref{sci-genie-core:data-layer:researchobj}. Figure \ref{figure18} shows the statistics of parsing using the heuristic parser from a total corpus of 158K papers. As the parser misses out many sections it can be further improved using better methods. The parser also considers the sections based on ones observed in CS papers. Future research directions can include identifying common patterns in the structure of research documents for fields outside CS; the identified structure can be used for providing additional context to search results. 


\subsection{LaTeX only Parsing}
Sci-Genie doesn't parse PDF and uses Latex instead. A lot of research in other fields is present in PDF and Sci-Genie doesn't have PDF mining capabilities. 

\subsection{CS ArXiv Only Access}
While ArXiv can be a source of freely availability well cited research, it also remains a preprint server where all documents are not gauranteed to be cited. Sci-Genie only supports CS ArXiv articles and its ontology is specialized for CS research. Future versions can extend the search engine to support more fields of research and use ontology for those fields. 

\section{Future Research Scope}
\label{conclusion:future-scope}
\subsection{Grannular Table Type Classification}
\label{conclusion:future-scope:type-class}

The table types defined by \cite{kim2012scientific} are general purpose descriptions which can apply to various domains. Although they are quite useful, tables in recent CS literature have more grannular sub-classifications. For example a "Statistics Table" could be describing a Dataset for Machine Learning experiments. The tables which may seem as Experiments Results can also be describing an Ablation Study conducted on a ML model. Due to a very nuanced distinction between a lot of these tables, The task of machine learning to classify table types needs more grannular sub-types within the classes defined by \cite{kim2012scientific}. 

Multiple grannular table types such as Ablation Study, Dataset Descriptions, can also be further described based on the field of research the tables belong to. The interface shown in Figure \ref{figure17}, was developed to annotated tables from scientific research. This interface can be extended for many fields outside CS for the effort of curation and benchmarking of ML models for indentification of various types of tables from different avenues of research. 

\subsection{Discovering Related Tables}
\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=\maxwidth{\textwidth}]{src/images/pwc-table-exp.pdf}
    \caption{ Viewing Tables From SOTA benchmarks }
    \label{figure\arabic{figurecounter}}
\end{figure}
\refstepcounter{figurecounter}
Organisations such as PapersWithCode(PwC) have developed tools to collate information about SOTA ML methods from papers on ArXiv. PwC after parsing these tables either correlate some metrics manually and some intelligently via the use of libraries like Axcell\footnote{https://github.com/paperswithcode/axcell}. This task can become more intelligent and automated where ML models can be developed to correlated tables from research documents from diverse domains outside CS. Discovering related tables using a citation graph and machine learning techniques can be a great direction for future research. 

\subsection{Scientific Research Document Parsing For Search Context}
Google search pivoted to ranking results for search using BERT.\footnote{https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/} since 2019. This trend of using language models to help rank search results has lead to creation of opensource tools\footnote{https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack} over off the shelf search engines like Elasticsearch. Although the models help improve search ranking, more nuanced search context result information is yet not accessible via academic research search engines. 

Intelligent parsing maybe one part of the solution. Sci-Genie are uses domain sepecific content parser which is heuristically derived (Chapter \ref{sci-genie-core:scraping:frag-to-rs}) to help bring context relevant information in search results. This parser may not be extensible to various other domains or document types.

\cite{kashyap2020sciwing}, introduced deep learning based techniques for scientific document parsing. But parsing can also be posed a domain specific problem where each domain generally follows a different parse structure. For example, recent papers in Machine Learning explicitly discuss datasets as a section in the paper.

Every domain's specific nuances requires more intelligent systems that can learn to identify such traits on their own. Intelligent techniques of parsing and indexing data to provide sufficient context to the users seems a rich direction of research in the future.

\section{Conclusion}
The fast rate of growth in technological progress will dramatically increase the growth in the volume of research in the future. Figure \ref{figure1}, is the best proof of that insight. The growing volume of research would also require more nuanced search tools which can help surface enough context around search terms and futher aid the researcher when reading research. This dissertation described a search engine and browser app based prototype solution to help remediate this problem. This dissertation covered the formulation of different aspects of the search engine and the ML models powering its table of comparison filtering algorithm. 

In summary, the proposed solutions in this dissertation try to remediate the problem of growth in the volume of research by aiding the researcher with more context based information when searching for research and reading research.

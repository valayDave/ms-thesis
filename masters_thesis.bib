The resulting literature graph consists of more than 280M nodes, representing papers, authors, entities and various interactions between them (e.g., authorships, citations, entity mentions). We reduce literature graph construction into familiar NLP tasks (e.g., entity extraction and linking), point out research challenges due to differences from standard formulations of these tasks, and report empirical results for each task. The methods described in this paper are used to enable semantic features in \url{www.semanticscholar.org}.",

At Gokulpura-Goverdhanpura village in Bundi Rajasthan, {ICRISAT} along with partners implemented integrated watershed project using holistic systems approach with integrated genetic and natural resource management ({IGNRM}) strategy. This report discusses the multi-faceted impact of this watershed program. It has been found that the science-led participatory watershed program at Gokulpura- Goverdhanpura had made positive impacts on natural resources, rural livelihoods and environment. The major impact of watershed interventions was seen in improving the surface and groundwater availability. Increased water availability resulted in increased cropping intensity and diversification to more remunerative land use systems involving livestock, horticultural and vegetable production. Overall, the watershed program has reduced land degradation, enhanced agricultural productivity and incomes, decreased poverty of rural poor, reduced labor migration and improved environment quality.},
